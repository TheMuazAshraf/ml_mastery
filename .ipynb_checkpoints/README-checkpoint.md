# ml_mastery

A structured collection of machine-learning fundamentals compiled as part of a completed ML course.  
This repository serves two purposes:

1. Reference material — each topic includes clean Python implementations and clear Markdown explanations inside Jupyter notebooks.  
2. Showcase of core ML foundations — algorithms, workflows, and preprocessing techniques.
